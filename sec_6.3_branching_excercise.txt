Branching Exercise
Part I


1. What git command creates a branch?
git checkout -b


2. What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
Fast forward merge is put one set of commits on top of another chronologically.
// fast forwards can only happen if there have not been commits on the original branch while the new branch is being worked on


3. What git command changes to another branch?
Git checkout


4. What git command deletes a branch?
Git branch -d


5. How do merge conflicts happen?
// When Git can not determine what file or folder to choose when merging since there have been different commits with changes to the same file


Part II
Practice with fast forward and recursive merges! Make a branch and add and commit onto it and merge it back into master.


Try to create your own merge conflict by modifying the same file on two separate commits on two separate branches.
